You start with 10 drops

Use them to grow blobs until they burst

Create combos to earn more drops

Grid - 6x6
Drop Count Display
Level # Display

Level 1 - 6 squares empty, rest have between 1 and 4 drops

When square with 4 drops gets one more drop, it explodes and sends drops in all 4 directions (up / down / left / right)

If enough (squares are cleared / blobs pop) then you earn more drops.  How many?

When you hover over a blob, it jiggles
When a drop hits a blob it first changes shape based on new drop count then jiggles
When a blob explodes, there is a small splash animation

How many drops in each square at start of each level?  Does the average number of drops in each square go down as levels get higher?
